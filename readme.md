# 🎬 ShortsMaker

ShortsMaker is a Python-based automation tool designed to streamline the process of creating engaging, vertical-format video clips from YouTube content. It's built for content creators who want to quickly generate shorts for platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.

## ✨ Features

* **URL Scraper** : Automatically identifies and scrapes related video links from a given YouTube video based on its tags.
* **Batch Downloader** : Downloads multiple videos concurrently from a generated list of URLs.
* **Automated Video Editing** : Extracts multiple short clips from a single video and automatically resizes them to the vertical 1080x1920 format.
* **Interactive CLI** : A simple command-line interface (`main.py`) to run the entire pipeline or individual components with ease.

## ⚙️ The Workflow

The project's workflow is a modular, three-step process controlled by the `main.py` script:

1. **Scrape URLs** (`urlscrapperyt.py`): You provide a single YouTube video URL. The script extracts relevant tags, searches for related videos, and saves their details into `tag_search_results.csv`.
2. **Download Videos** (`videodownloder.py`): This script reads the `tag_search_results.csv` file, downloads each video to the `downloads/` directory, and organizes them for the next step.
3. **Create Shorts** (`shorts_creator.py`): Finally, the script processes all videos found in `downloads/`, creates multiple clips of a predefined duration, and exports them to the `shorts/` folder, padded and resized to the vertical 1080x1920 aspect ratio.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x and the necessary libraries installed. All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd ShortsMaker
```

2. (Optional but Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install all required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Run the main script to start the interactive menu:

```bash
python main.py
```

You will see a menu with several options:

```

1. 🔍 Run URL Scraper
2. ⬇️  Run Downloader
3. ✂️  Run Shorts Creator
4. ❌ Exit
5. 🤖 Run Full Pipeline (Downloader + Shorts)
```

* To run the entire automated process, simply select `5`.
* To run each step individually, select `1`, then `2`, then `3` in that order.

```

## 🛠️ Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the scripts by editing the configuration variables at the top of each file:

* `urlscrapperyt.py`: Adjust `MAX_TAGS` and `VIDEOS_PER_TAG` to control the scope of the scraping.
* `shorts_creator.py`: Modify `CLIP_LENGTH` to set the duration of the output shorts.

## 🚧 Future Features

This project is a first prototype, and a number of new features are planned to enhance its functionality, including:

* Adding background music to the shorts.
* Automated caption generation for clips.
* An improved graphical user interface (GUI).
* Additional video-editing features like transitions and effects.

We welcome contributions and suggestions for improving the project!
